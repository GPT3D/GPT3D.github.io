	<h1>Hi there, I'm Rajendra!</h1>
	<p>I'm an undergraduate student at <em>CSE, IIT Palakkad.</em> I'm passionate about vision-based robotics. I participated in several robotics and ML competitions. My major projects are based on the swarm, slam and vision-based pick and place. I am currently working on mobile manipulators based on ROS. My goal is to run a robotics research lab and learn more about the field along the way. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
