	<h1>Hi there, I'm Rajendra!</h1>
	<p><img src="images/rajendra_passport_photo.jpg" height="230" width="182" align="left" />I'm an undergraduate student at <em>CSE, IIT Palakkad.</em> I'm passionate about vision-based robotics. I've participated in several robotics and ML related competitions. I was the former head of Robotics Club, IIT Palakkad. My major projects are based on the swarm, slam and vision-based pick and place. I am currently working on mobile manipulators based on ROS. My goal is to lead a robotics research lab and learn more about the field along the way. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
