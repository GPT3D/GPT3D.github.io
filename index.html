		<br/>I'm a final year student of Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Palakkad.
		I'm passionate about vision-based robotics.
		Iâ€™m research-oriented, team player and kin to collaborate with an enthusiastic team or startup in this domain.
		I've participated in several robotics and ml competitions. I was the former head of Robotics Club, IIT Palakkad.
		My major projects are based on the swarm, path planning, slam and vision-based pick and place.
		I am currently working on mobile manipulators based on ROS.
		My goal is to run a robotics research lab and learn more about the field along the way.
