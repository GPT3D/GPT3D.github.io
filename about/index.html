	<h2>A Brief Background</h2>
	<p>I was born in Rajsamand, Rajasthan, India in 1997, and brought up and educated there. I complete my secondary education from Rajsamand and higher secondary from Delhi Public School, Udaipur.</p>
	<p>Since childhood days, I was popularly regarded as a gadget freak. As an aspiring technocrat, I firmly believe it is important to not only learn, but also understand, implement, develop and embrace the latest technology trends.</p>
	<p>Apart from academics,I also maintain a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNSEsxHfpq_84-EkU9CRnQ/videos?view_as=subscriber">YouTube channel</a> which hosts videos of my projects, interesting tech stuff I work on.</p>

	<h2>How did I develop an interest in Robotics?</h2>
	<p>In my childhood, I used to play with many RC toys. Many a time also opened them with curiousity to see what's inside. It certainly helped me to chose robotics later.
	During my time at IIT Palakkad I participated in various regional and national level competions and headed many projects.
	I also headed the robotic club and mentored many student project here at IIT Palakkad.
	This involvement in various projects and proper guidance professor(Specially Prof. Santa Mohan Kumar, M.E, IIT Palakkad and Chandra Shekar, CSE IIT Palakkad) further helped me to grow my passionate interest in the field of robotics.</p>
