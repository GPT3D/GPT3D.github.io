	<ul class="projects">
		<li><a href="https://github.com/iamrajee/kaggle/tree/master/TaxiTimePredict">Taxi trip time predicton</a></li>
		<p><font size="3">Created machine learning model for taxi trip time prediction from initial partial trajectories.</font></p>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/iamrajee/Satellite_Image_Classfication">Satellite Image Classification</a></li>
		<p><font size="3"></font>Build CNN based model for satellite image classification of 9 categories, challenge was to train model model using mere 14 images. We got the overall accuracy of 71.85%.</font></p>
		<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B5k8_0QPwT3smCKnMK9Dd8N9MWVTcHdE?usp=sharing">ROS based surveiling robot</a></li>
		<p><font size="3"></font>Create ROS based surveilling all-terrain robot, which has features like face-detection, live stream, audio command and feedback.</font></p>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/iamrajee/bio_medical">Electrooculogram based Assistive Communication System</a></li>
		<p><font size="3">Developed an EOG based typing system that uses a virtual keyboard to assist individuals with motor neuron diseases to communicate. Eye saccades were tracked by acquiring signals from muscles surrounding the eye, conditioned using cleverly designed analog circuits.</font></p>
		<li><a href="https://youtu.be/fiKWWNUrDsA">Prusa i3 3D Printer and 3D Printed Robotic Arm</a></li>
		<p><font size="3">Built a Prusa i3 3D Printer and 3D Printed Robotic Arm (using our own built printer) under Vistaar Program of CFI, IIT Madras. • Studied state of the art 3D printing processes. • Worked on Photogrammetry (generating 3D models using a set of 2D images of an object). • Assembled a Prusa i3 3D printer from its basic components, which was further used to fabricate parts for an Arduino controlled Gripper Arm. The project was showcased during the CFI Open House 2017, at IIT Madras.</font></p>
		<li><a href="https://youtu.be/ZBkGvumVWXU">Automated Toilet Cleaning Robot</a></li>
		<p><font size="3">Built Automated Toilet Cleaning Robot which cleans the floor of a toilet and picks the tissue papers and cleans the toilet seat. It is fully Autonomous and informs when a task is complete. Ranked 6th in Inter IIT Tech Meet </font></p>
		<li><a href="https://youtu.be/5CcwcbmCqMU">IOT based Autonomous Farming</a></li>
		<p><font size="3">Built an IOT based autonomous farming under Makerthon 2017, Lema Labs, IIT Madras Research Park in 36 hours. Here we collect the various live data viz. moisture, temperature, humidity, illegal entry in farm and send them to the server and remotely moniter them. </font></p>
